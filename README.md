# EEG-SVM-Decoding_Spatial-Normalization
This code serves as a basic toolbox for performing SVM-based MVPA decoding on EEG datasets. The code supports within-subject and between-subject (leave-one-subject-out validation) decoding strategies. After decoding, users can visualize the results and perform statistical comparisons using the provided figure generation scripts.
